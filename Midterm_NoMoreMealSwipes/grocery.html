        <p class= grocerytext> It is challenging to buy groceries and stay on a budget in college, which is why students often gravitate towards unhealthy snacks. But...eating healthy doesn't have to be expensive! Below I have a list of the grocery stores that I go to and what I usually buy from each one! I hope this grocery list can be a useful guide!</p>
        
            <h3 class="grocerystores">Trader Joe's</h3>
        
                <li>fruit: apples, blueberries, grapes, and strawberries (I love fruits!! you can buy fruits for cheaper and in bulk at Trader Joe's which is a great way to save money!!)</li>
                <li>fresh vegetables: broccoli, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, and packets of spinach or kale </li>
                <li>frozen vegetaables: peas, corn, edamame, and spinach (buying frozen veggies saves money and lasts for months!)</li>
                <li>lemons</li>
                <li>hummus (great after-school snack with carrots!)</li>
                <li>vegan pesto (can be used as a dip or healthy pasta sauce!)</li>
                <li>eggs (I boil my eggs and bring them for lunch)</li>
                <li>gluten free toast (or brown rice cakes if you don't have a toaster)</li>
                <li>peanut butter</li>
                <li>butternut squash soup (just put in the microwave for 3 mins and voila!)</li>
                <li>quinoa</li>
                <li>rosemary ham or turkey (good sources of protein!)</li>
                <li>avocado (amazing on top of salads or toast)</li>
                <li>sweet potatoes</li>
                <li>almond milk</li>
                <li>greek feta cheese (I buy the sheep's milk because it is less processed and better for you!)</li>

    
        
        <h3 class="grocerystores">Whole Foods</h3>
        
            <p class= grocerytext>Whole Foods is definitly on the pricey side, but a few of my favorite healthy products are only sold at Whole Foods so I buy them there!</p>
