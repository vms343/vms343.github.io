    <p class="descriptiontext">Hi! I'm Vida! An 18 year old college student who is passionate about healthy eating and mindfuless. Being away from my mom's high-quality home cooked meals encouraged me to create an Instagram page (@nomoremealswipes!!) where I post the healthy recipes that I cook during my time at college. I created this website to share my nutritious, delicious, and easy meal ideas as well as my mindfulness tips. I also wanted to share my favorite healthy restaurants from New York, San Francisco, and while traveling! On the side, I enjoy yoga, reading, photography, entrepreneurship, and design! I am here to help college students mantain healthy habits and with my recipes, I promise you will no longer miss those home-cooked meals! </p>
