        Upon my arrival into the Fairfax District, the first thing that stood out to me was the prominent Orthodox Jewish population. A look into the history of the Fairfax District reveals why that is. 

        The first group of people who inhabited the Fairfax District were the Tongva (a group of Native Americans living in the Los Angeles area). However, by the 1920s, the white population took over. Most areas of Los Angeles were segregated and homes were only owned by the white. 

        By the 1940s and prior to World War II, some Jewish families migrated to the Fairfax District together. They aimed to establish a community in this area and began by building cultural delis, restaurants, kosher butcher shops, bakeries, and more. 

        Following World War II, Holocaust survivors all moved to the Fairfax neighborhood. The number of Jewish synagogues increased and the area became primarily dominated by the Jewish. 

        In 1987, an 18 foot statue was placed on Fairfax Avenue in order to honor Raoul Wallenberg, a diplomat who had saved thousands of Jews from being deported to Nazi death camps. The area became a supportive and welcoming environment for Jewish families and communities.

            On a walk around the neighborhood, I spoke with a father and his two sons who were on their way to the synagogue. Talking with the father, I learned about the importance of community and family for the Jewish population. The father shared about why he chose to live here and how he feels a sense of belonging in this area. He is happy that his kids can grow up in an environment where they are surrounded by schools, restaurants, stores, and museums that represent their culture. It is a safe, loving community to live in.

        It is most known for its proximity to The Grove shopping center, the CBS TV broadcasting center, the LA Museum of the Holocaust, as well as various restaurants and shops.

        Beverely Hills was originally known as El Rodeo de las Aguas, which means “the gathering of the waters” in Spanish. 

        The city was built on a Spanish ranch named “Beverly Hills” that grew lima beans. When the original developers of Beverly Hills came there to strike oil, they found no oil, but did find water. This discovery of water is what allowed them to build the subdivision that became Beverly Hills.

            It is for this reason that the area is heavily inspired by Spanish architecture.

            In 1907, architect Wilbur D. Cook was hired to design a street plan for Beverly Hills. He designed the area with curving streets and a mix of large and small lots. There was land set aside for parks and education as well. The area was meant to be affordable to people of different income levels as long as they weren’t Jewish or Black. 

            Things began to change with the construction of the Beverly Hills Hotel in 1912. This was a luxurious establishment that served travelers and locals.

            In 1919, the glamorous movie-star couple Mary Pickford and Douglas Banks bought a lot in the area, which became known as Pickfair. The area began attracting industry stars, directors, and producers like this couple. 

            Beverly Hills became the epicenter for the production of films and TV series as well as many talent agencies, which opened the doors to many Hollywood stars. 
            
            After recovery from World War II in the late 1940s, the city began developing quickly. The city focused on building Rodeo Drive, a street full of internationally renowned retailers and restaurants. By the 1950s, the area became renowned for its luxury shopping, large homes, and fine dining.
